### Contribute to this project
This project started off as a plain [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) table with two buttons for adding and removing rows. The only thing I made sure that the calculation was made perfect (cons of being developer and not designer). Much kudos to @sadarshannaiynar for providing a soothing material design :smiley:
